This is my inaugural project undertaken during my internshipâ€”a comprehensive expense tracker developed using React, with the UI meticulously designed using Tailwind CSS. Leveraging Redux for state management, I ensured seamless data flow and enhanced scalability. Additionally, I opted for Vite as the build tool for React, prioritizing efficiency and speed throughout the development process.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
